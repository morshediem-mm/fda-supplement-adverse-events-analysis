# Phase 1: Ask

## Problem Statement

Dietary supplements and herbal products are widely used by consumers, often without clear visibility into potential adverse effects or safety risks.

This project addresses the need to systematically examine FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) data in order to identify reporting patterns related to dietary and herbal supplements, including frequency of adverse events and indicators of severity.

The analysis focuses on reported associations rather than clinical causation and aims to surface products that may warrant closer monitoring.

## Project Objectives

The objective of this analysis is to use FDA FAERS data to:

- Identify dietary and herbal supplements most frequently associated with adverse event reports
- Understand the most commonly reported adverse reactions
- Evaluate indicators of event severity, including hospitalization outcomes
- Assess demographic patterns among reported cases
- Support data-driven recommendations for supplement safety monitoring

---

## Scope of Analysis

- **Data Source**: FDA FAERS Quarterly Data Extract
- **Time Period**: April 1 – June 30, 2025 (Q2 2025)
- **Product Focus:** Dietary supplements and herbal products
- **Analysis Level:** Aggregate reporting patterns and severity indicators

---

## Key Analytical Questions

1. Which dietary and herbal supplements are most frequently associated with adverse event reports?
2. What types of adverse reactions are reported most often?
3. Which demographic groups report the highest number of adverse events?
4. What proportion of reported events resulted in hospitalization?
5. Which supplements demonstrate patterns that may warrant increased safety monitoring?

## Stakeholders

- FDA regulatory and safety teams
- Healthcare professionals
- Consumers using dietary supplements
- Data analysts reviewing safety trends

---

## Assumptions and Limitations

- FAERS data reflects **reported associations**, not confirmed causation
- Reports may include incomplete, duplicate, or biased submissions
- Adverse events may be influenced by concurrent medications or underlying conditions
- Findings are intended to identify trends, not establish clinical conclusions
